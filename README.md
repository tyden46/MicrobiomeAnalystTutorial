# MicrobiomeAnalyst Tutorial with COVID-19 Patient Metagenomic Data
## This tutorial will briefly teach you how to use some modules of MicrobiomeAnalyst to do metagenomics-based analyses on samples collected from COVID-19 positive patients
### Steps
#### 1. Download these three files from this repository: OTU.txt, Metadata.txt, Taxonomy.txt
#### 2. Visit https://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca/MicrobiomeAnalyst/upload/OtuUploadView.xhtml and upload the files as seen here (and make sure to select "Not Specific/Other" for taxonomy labels:

#### 3. Select "Submit" and wait for processing to complete
#### 4. Navigate to "Library Size Overview" tab and review the data from our samples. Two samples, 323 and 276, have very few counts so we should remove them. We will do this in the next step, for now just remember or write down those numbers.

#### 5. Review the data integrity check tab and click "proceed"
#### 6. In the feature filter tab keep the defaults the same and click "submit"
#### 7. Navigate to the "Sample Editor" tab and we will remove 323 and 276 like we said we would in step 4. To do this find the samples from the list on the left, select them one at a time by clicking on them, and then press the top arrow that points to the right.
