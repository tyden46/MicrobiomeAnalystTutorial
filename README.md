#### 3. Select "Submit" and wait for processing to complete
#### 4. Navigate to "Library Size Overview" tab and review the data from our samples. Two samples, 323 and 276, have very few counts so we should remove them. We will do this in the next step, for now just remember or write down those numbers.
